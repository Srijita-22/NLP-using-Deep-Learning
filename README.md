◦ Developed and trained deep learning models for Natural Language Processing tasks such as text 
classification, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition using frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch. 
◦ Preprocessed and tokenized large datasets, applying techniques such as word embeddings (Word2Vec, 
GloVe) and transformers (BERT, GPT). 
◦ Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and BLEU, achieving significant 
improvement in predictive accuracy.
